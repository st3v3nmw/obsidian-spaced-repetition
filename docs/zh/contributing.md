## Translating

### Steps

To help translate the plugin to your language:

1. Fork the [repository](https://github.com/st3v3nmw/obsidian-spaced-repetition).
2. Copy the entries from `src/lang/locale/en.ts` to the proper file in `src/lang/locale/` (i.e. `fr.ts` for French, or `sw.ts` for Swahili). The locale codes are [IETF language tags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag).
3. Translate,
4. Then open a pull request,

### Example

Sample `en.ts` file:

```typescript
// English

export default {
    EASY: "Easy",
    SHOW_ANSWER: "Show Answer",
    DAYS_STR_IVL: "${interval} days",
    CHECK_ALGORITHM_WIKI:
        'For more information, check the <a href="${algo_url}">algorithm implementation</a>.',
};
```

Equivalent `sw.ts` file:

```typescript
// Swahili

export default {
    EASY: "Rahisi",
    SHOW_ANSWER: "Onyesha Jibu",
    DAYS_STR_IVL: "Siku ${interval}",
    CHECK_ALGORITHM_WIKI:
        'Kwa habari zaidi, angalia <a href="${algo_url}">utekelezaji wa algorithm</a>.',
};
```

<sub><sup>A part of that last one is uhh, Google translated, I have a working understanding of Swahili but not enough to write computerese lol.</sup></sub>

Please note that:

1. Only the strings(templates) on the right of the key should be translated.
2. Text inside `${}` isn't translated. This is used to replace variables in code. For instance, if interval = 4, it becomes `4 days` in English & `Siku 4` in Swahili. Quite nifty if you ask me.

## Code

1. Make your changes.
2. Run `pnpm dev` to test the changes inside Obsidian.
3. You could create symbolic links between the build files and the Obsidian vault, example:

    ```bash
    # remove existing files in the Obsidian vault
    rm ~/notes/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-spaced-repetition/main.js ~/notes/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-spaced-repetition/manifest.json ~/notes/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-spaced-repetition/styles.css
    # use absolute paths
    ln -s /home/stephen/obsidian-spaced-repetition/build/main.js /home/stephen/notes/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-spaced-repetition
    ln -s /home/stephen/obsidian-spaced-repetition/manifest.json /home/stephen/notes/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-spaced-repetition
    ln -s /home/stephen/obsidian-spaced-repetition/styles.css /home/stephen/notes/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-spaced-repetition
    ```

    - This can be coupled with the [Hot Reload plugin](https://github.com/pjeby/hot-reload)

4. Document the "user-facing" changes e.g. new feature, UI change, etc.
5. If your "business logic" is properly decoupled from Obsidian APIs, write some unit tests.
    - This project uses [jest](https://jestjs.io/), tests are stored in `tests/`.
    - `pnpm test`
6. Add your change to the `[Unreleased]` section of the changelog (`docs/changelog.md`).
    - The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), TL;DR:
        - `Added` for new features.
        - `Changed` for changes in existing functionality.
        - `Deprecated` for soon-to-be removed features.
        - `Removed` for now removed features.
        - `Fixed` for any bug fixes.
        - `Security` in case of vulnerabilities.
    - You can also append a link to your GitHub profile, example:
        - `Make flashcard text selectable [@st3v3nmw](https://github.com/st3v3nmw)`
7. Before pushing your changes, run the linter: `pnpm lint`
    - Format the code in case any warnings are raised: `pnpm format`
8. Open the pull request.

## Documentation

The documentation consists of Markdown files which [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) converts to static web pages.
Specifically, this project uses [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/).

These files reside in `docs/` in the respective language's folder. For instance, English docs are located in `docs/en/`.

The docs are served on [https://www.stephenmwangi.com/obsidian-spaced-repetition/](https://www.stephenmwangi.com/obsidian-spaced-repetition/).

For small changes, you can simply open an pull request for merging (against the `master` branch).
The changes will be live once a new [release](https://github.com/st3v3nmw/obsidian-spaced-repetition/releases) is made.

For larger diffs, it's important that you check how your docs look like as explained below.

### Viewing Docs Locally

#### Initial Setup

1. Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv`
2. Activate it: `. venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

#### Viewing

1. Activate the virtual environment: `. venv/bin/activate`
2. Serve the docs: `mkdocs serve`
3. View your documentation locally on [http://127.0.0.1:8000/obsidian-spaced-repetition/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/obsidian-spaced-repetition/), any changes you make will reflect on the browser instantly.

### Translating Documentation

1. Create a folder for your language in `docs/` if it doesn't exist. Use the language codes provided [here](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/changing-the-language/#site-language).
2. Add the code from (1) to the MkDocs configuration (`mkdocs.yml` - `plugins.i18n.languages`).
3. Copy the files from the English (`en`) folder into the new folder.
4. Translate then open a pull request.

## Maintenance

### Releases

Example using `v1.9.2`:

1. Create a new branch: `git switch -c release-v1.9.2`
2. Bump the plugin version in `manifest.json` and `package.json` (following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)).
    - Semantic Versioning TL;DR, given a version number `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, increment the:
        - `MAJOR` version when you make incompatible API changes
        - `MINOR` version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner
        - `PATCH` version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes
    - If the new version uses new Obsidian APIs, update `minAppVersion` and `versions.json` to reflect this.
3. Run `pnpm changelog` to update the CHANGELOG.
4. Commit and push the changes:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Bump version to v1.9.2"
    git push --set-upstream origin release-v1.9.2
    ```

5. Open and merge the PR into `master`.
6. Locally, switch back to `master` and pull the changes: `git switch master && git pull`
7. Create a git tag with the version: `git tag 1.9.2`
8. Push the tag: `git push --tags`. <br> You're all set! [This GitHub action](https://github.com/st3v3nmw/obsidian-spaced-repetition/blob/master/.github/workflows/release.yml) should pick it up, create a release, publish it, and update the live documentation.
