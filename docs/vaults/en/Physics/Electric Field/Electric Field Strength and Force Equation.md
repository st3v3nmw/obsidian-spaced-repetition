The field is denoted by E, and as it is a vector  $\large  \vec  E$ it is given by the formula:

 $\huge  \vec  E =  \frac   {\vec F_e} C$

In terms of the field strength $\large  \vec E$ at a particular point, what is the force experienced by a particle with charge $\large C$:: $\large  \vec  F_e =  \vec E \times C$
<!--SR:!2024-10-19,96,230-->

In the equation $\large  \vec  F_e =  \vec E \times C$, both $\large  \vec  F_e$ and $\large  \vec E$ are vectors. What is the relationship of the direction of the two?::For a positive charge, the force is in the same direction as the field, for a negative charge the force is in the opposite direction
