    What does this mean?

In short, there are four possible actions (where `x < y`):

-   skip note (increase interval for `x`) == mark as `good`
-   work on it, mark as fruitful work (decrease interval) == mark as `hard`
-   work on it, mark as unfruitful work (increase interval for `y`) == mark as `easy`
-   convert to evergreen note (stop using the space-repetition prompts)
