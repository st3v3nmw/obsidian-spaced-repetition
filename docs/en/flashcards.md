# Flashcards

## Creating

[Piotr Wozniak's 20 rules of knowledge formulation](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/20_rules_of_knowledge_formulation) is a great introduction on proper flashcard creation.

### Single-line Basic (Remnote style)

The prompt and the answer are separated by `::` (this can be configured in settings).

```markdown
the question goes on this side::answer goes here!
```

### Single-line Reversed

Creates two cards `side1:::side2` & the reversed version `side2:::side1`.

The prompt and the answer are separated by `:::` (this can be configured in settings).

```markdown
the question goes on this side:::answer goes here!
```

### Multi-line Basic

The front and the back of the card are separated by `?` (this can be configured in settings).

```markdown
Front of multiline
?
Backside of multiline card
```

These can also span over multiple lines as long as both sides "touch" the `?`:

```markdown
As per the definition
of "multiline" the prompt
can be on multiple lines
?
same goes for
the answer
```

### Multi-line Reversed

Creates two cards `side1??side2` & the reversed version `side2??side1`.

The front and the back of the card are separated by `??` (this can be configured in settings).

```markdown
Front of multiline
??
Backside of multiline card
```

These can also span over multiple lines as long as both sides "touch" the `??`:

```markdown
As per the definition
of "multiline" the prompt
can be on multiple lines
??
same goes for
the answer
```

### Cloze cards

You can easily add cloze deletion cards using `==highlights==`, `**bolded text**`, or `{{text in curly braces}}`.

These can be turned on or off in settings.

Anki style `{{c1:This text}} would {{c2:generate}} {{c1:2 cards}}` cloze deletions are not currently supported. This feature is being tracked [here](https://github.com/st3v3nmw/obsidian-spaced-repetition/issues/93/).

## Decks

![Screenshot from 2021-06-05 19-28-24](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43380836/120922211-78603400-c6d0-11eb-9d09-bdd5df1c9112.png)

The green and blue counts on the right of each deck name represent due and new cards respectively.

### Using Obsidian Tags

1. Specify flashcard tags in settings (`#flashcards` is the default).
2. Tag any notes that you'd like to put flashcards using said tags.

#### Hierarchical Tags

Note that `#flashcards` will match nested tags like `#flashcards/subdeck/subdeck`.

### Using Folder Structure

The plugin will automatically search for folders that contain flashcards & use their paths to create decks & sub-decks i.e. `Folder/sub-folder/sub-sub-folder` â‡” `Deck/sub-deck/sub-sub-deck`.

This is an alternative to the tagging option and can be enabled in settings.

## Reviewing

Once done creating cards, click on the flashcards button on the left ribbon to start reviewing the flashcards. After a card is reviewed, a HTML comment is added containing the next review day, the interval, and the card's ease.

```
<!--SR:!2021-08-20,13,290-->
```

Wrapping in a HTML comment makes the scheduling information not visible in the notes preview. For single-line cards, you can choose whether you want the HTML comment on the same line or on a separate line in the settings. Putting them on the same line prevents breaking of list structures in the preview or after auto-formatting.

Note that you can skip a card by simply pressing `S` (case doesn't matter).

!!! tip

    If you're experiencing issues with the size of the modal on mobile devices,
    go to settings and set the _Flashcard Height Percentage_ and _Flashcard Width Percentage_
    to 100% to maximize it.

### Faster Review

To review faster, use the following keyboard shortcuts:

-   `Space/Enter` => Show answer
-   `0` => Reset card's progress (Sorta like `Again` in Anki)
-   `1` => Review as `Hard`
-   `2` or `Space` => Review as `Good`
-   `3` => Review as `Easy`

### Context

If the parent note has heading(s), the flashcard will have a title containing the context.

Taking the following note:

```markdown
#flashcards

# Trivia

## Capitals

### Africa

Kenya::Nairobi

### North America

Canada::Ottawa
```

The flashcard for `Kenya::Nairobi` will have `Trivia > Capitals > Africa` as the context/title whereas the flashcard for `Canada::Ottawa` will have `Trivia > Capitals > North America` as the context/title.

### Deleting cards

To delete a card, simply delete the scheduling information & the card text.

### Ignoring cards

You can wrap flashcards in HTML comments e.g. `<!--Card text <!--SR:2021-08-20,13,290--> -->` to prevent it from showing up in your review queues. You can always remove the wrapping comment later.

## Cramming

Currently, the only supported method is "cramming" all cards in a note using the Cram flashcards in this note command. Will work on a per-deck across-all-notes method.

## Statistics

The statistics section can be accessed using the `View Statistics` command.

### Forecast

Stats on the number of cards due in the future.
