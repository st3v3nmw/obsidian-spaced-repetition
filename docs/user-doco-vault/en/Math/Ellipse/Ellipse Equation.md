The general equation of an ellipse is used to algebraically represent an ellipse in the coordinate plane. The equation of an ellipse can be given as,

$\large \frac  {x ^2}  {a ^2}+\frac  {y ^2}  {b ^2}=1$

Where

- 'a' represents the [[Semi-Major Axis|semi-major axis]] (half of the length of the major axis)
- 'b' represents the [[Semi-Minor Axis|semi-minor axis]] (half of the length of the minor axis)

Given lengths a and b (half the length of the major and minor axes respectively), and a coordinate system with origin half way between an ellipse's foci, what is the ellipse's equation
?
$\large \frac  {x ^2}  {a ^2}+\frac  {y ^2}  {b ^2}=1$
