In mathematics, an ellipse is a:
- closed curve that 
- is symmetric with respect to two perpendicular axes. 
- It can be defined as the set of all points in a plane, such that the sum of the distances from any point on the curve to two fixed points (called the [[Focus|foci]]) is constant. 
- The fixed points are called the foci and are denoted by F and F'.
